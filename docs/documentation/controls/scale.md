The *ScaleControl* component displays a scale bar on the map, providing users with a visual representation of distance.

It adjusts dynamically as users zoom in and out, giving them a clear sense of scale in relation to the mapâ€™s content.

This is especially useful in applications where users need to gauge distances, such as in geographical or navigational contexts.

**Reference**: [ScaleControl](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/classes/ScaleControl)

## Usage

The *ScaleControl* is easy to add to your map and provides an automatic scale bar that adjusts based on the zoom level and the map's current viewport.

You can customize its position to suit your application's layout.
