The *SymbolLayer* component is designed to display icons and text on the map at specific locations.

It allows you to add markers, labels, or custom symbols using various layout and paint properties to control their appearance and behavior.

This layer is especially useful for adding annotations, labels for points of interest, or custom icons to enhance the mapâ€™s interactivity.

**Reference**: [Symbol](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/layers/#symbol)

## Usage

The *SymbolLayer* is typically used with a source like *GeojsonSource* that contains point data.

<example id="layers/symbol" />

## Style customization

You can customize the layout properties to control how icons and text are rendered on the map, including their size, color, placement, and rotation.

In the following example we're gonna be removing the text of the symbol, reduce the icon size and reduce the opacity.

<example id="layers/symbol-style" />
