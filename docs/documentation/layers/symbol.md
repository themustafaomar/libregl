The *SymbolLayer* component is designed to display icons and text on the map at specific locations.

It allows you to add markers, labels, or custom symbols using various layout and paint properties to control their appearance and behavior.

This layer is especially useful for adding annotations, labels for points of interest, or custom icons to enhance the mapâ€™s interactivity.

**Reference**: [Symbol](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/layers/#symbol)

## Usage

The *SymbolLayer* is typically used with a source like *GeojsonSource* that contains point data.

<example id="layers/symbol" />

## Style customization

You can customize the layout properties to control how icons and text are rendered on the map, including their size, color, placement, and rotation.

In the following example we're gonna be removing the text of the symbol, reduce the icon size and reduce the opacity.

<example id="layers/symbol-style" />

## Listening to events

You can listen to layer's events once you pass the event name like `@click`, `@mousemove` and more, to learn more about supported events please visit the offical documentation at [MapLayerEventType](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/type-aliases/MapLayerEventType/).

| metadata | Arbitrary properties useful to track with the layer, but do not influence rendering. Properties should be prefixed to avoid collisions, like 'maplibre:'. | *Optional* |
| source | Name of a source description to be used for this layer. | *Optional* [GeoJSONSourceSpecification](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/sources/#geojson) or `string` |
| minzoom | The minimum zoom level for the layer. At zoom levels less than the minzoom, the layer will be hidden. | *Optional* `number` in range [0, 24]. |
| maxzoom | The maximum zoom level for the layer. At zoom levels equal to or greater than the maxzoom, the layer will be hidden. | *Optional* `number` in range [0, 24]. |
| filter | A expression specifying conditions on source features. Only features that match the filter are displayed. Zoom expressions in filters are only evaluated at integer zoom levels. The feature-state expression is not supported in filter expressions. | *Optional* [filter](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/expressions/) |
| layout | Layout properties for the layer. | *Optional* [HeatmapSpecification['layout']](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/layers/#circle-sort-key) |
