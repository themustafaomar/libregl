The *BackgroundLayer* component is used to style the base background of a map.

Unlike other layers that display data like lines or points, the *BackgroundLayer* provides a solid or patterned fill that can be customized with paint properties such as color, opacity, and pattern.

This layer is useful for setting the map's base appearance, which serves as the visual backdrop for all other layers.

**Reference**: [Background](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/layers/#background)

## Usage

The *BackgroundLayer* doesnâ€™t require a data source and is typically added to control the visual background of the map, here is an example using an image pattern.

<example id="layers/background" />
